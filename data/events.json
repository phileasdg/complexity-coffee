		"description_html": "<p><strong>Atiyab Zafar</strong> presented \"Rising inequality and power shifting from core to parasitic periphery are warnings to collapse in a model of complex adaptive systems\".</p><p>Understanding why collapses occur in complex systems matters for forecasting and response planning. In this talk, Atiyab went over their work on studying collapses in a model of an evolving directed network, where node “strength” is given by its eigenvector centrality. The network evolves by repeatedly removing the weakest node and replacing it with a sparsely and randomly connected node with probability p. Despite its simplicity, the model exhibits spontaneous growth, long stable plateaus, and sudden crashes in which the number of nonzero-strength nodes drops by a large fraction in a single step. Atiyab went through what collapses are in the context of the model and then showed that inequality in node strengths rises as collapse approaches, quantified via the Gini coefficient. At the same time, the periphery (nodes that are effectively parasites in that they draw support from the core without feeding back into it) becomes stronger on average than the core, indicating a “power shift” from core to periphery. A small number of high-strength periphery nodes drive the rising inequality. These signals may offer insights for thinking about power, inequality, and instability in social systems.</p><p><strong>Akshara Aravinda</strong> presented \"Memory and Inheritance of gene expression states in stochastic biochemical networks\".</p><p>Cells constantly experience fluctuations at the RNA, protein and epigenetic levels. These fluctuations lead to distinct cell states even among genetically identical populations. This non-genetic heterogeneity plays an important role in how cells respond to stress: for example, rare subsets in both bacterial and cancer populations surviving targeted drug therapy and subsequently proliferating further. Recent experiments show that this is due to expression fluctuations of so-called \"memory genes\" persisting across multiple cell generations, giving rise to long-lived lineage correlations. In this talk, Akshara presented a theoretical framework that explains how such memory emerges directly from stochastic gene expression dynamics in growing and dividing cells. Starting from the chemical master equation, Akshara used the linear noise approximation to derive explicit expressions for gene expression correlations across an arbitrary number of generations, showing that memory is not only a property of individual molecular lifetimes, but also at the level of the regulatory network. Overall, this work offers a predictive framework for understanding heritable variability in growing populations.</p>",

		"description_html": "<p>Dr. Bowles surveys archaeological evidence from Neolithic western Eurasia suggesting that while wealth inequality occurred, it was rare and ephemeral compared to the later enduring inequalities that persist to this day. He argues that a culture of \"aggressive egalitarianism\" may have thwarted enduring inequality until new farming technologies and elite power concentration in the Late Neolithic provided conditions for it to persist.</p><p>Dr. Sam Bowles is a Resident Faculty Member at the Santa Fe Institute and co-founder of the CORE project. An interdisciplinary scientist spanning behavioral economics and evolutionary theory, he is best known for his work on the evolution of human cooperation and the origins of inequality.</p>",

		"description_html": "<p>Participatory modeling (PM) is particularly well-suited to address complex socio-environmental problems like climate hazards and their implications for sustainable resource management and landscape planning. Despite its potential to inform planning and policy, particularly in conflictive contexts, PM has yet to become a mainstream practice for decision-making. While most PM research and development has focused on modeling tools and engagement techniques, multiple other dimensions must be recognized and articulated for impactful planning support. I present a PM platform, Fora.ai, that supports the iterative steps in PM: problem definition and goal setting, preference elicitation, collaborative scenario-building, simulation, tradeoff deliberation, and solution-building. I demonstrate the platform's effectiveness when embedded in a stakeholder-led process that integrates diverse knowledge, data sources, and values in pursuit of impactful green infrastructure (GI) planning to address flooding. I show how the combination of specific facilitation practices and platform features leverages the power of data, computational modeling, and social complexity to contribute to collaborative learning, creative and convergent solution-building for urban sustainability and climate resilience.</p>",
