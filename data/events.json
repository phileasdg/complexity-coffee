Community talks are seminar-style talks by CGS participants, and EPE network members, designed to showcase ongoing research and projects, share theoretical and methodological approaches, and stimulate critical discussion and collaboration across disciplinary and institutional boundaries.</p><p>Presenters will have 30 minutes to present, followed by 10 minutes for discussion. Two presentations will be shared per session.</p><p>Interested? Have something you want to share? Have a question? Fill out this form by 28 January 2026 at 0830 MST.</p>",

		"description_html": "<p>Dr. Bowles surveys archaeological evidence from Neolithic western Eurasia suggesting that while wealth inequality occurred, it was rare and ephemeral compared to the later enduring inequalities that persist to this day. He argues that a culture of \"aggressive egalitarianism\" may have thwarted enduring inequality until new farming technologies and elite power concentration in the Late Neolithic provided conditions for it to persist.</p><p>Dr. Sam Bowles is a Resident Faculty Member at the Santa Fe Institute and co-founder of the CORE project. An interdisciplinary scientist spanning behavioral economics and evolutionary theory, he is best known for his work on the evolution of human cooperation and the origins of inequality.</p>",

		"description_html": "<p>Participatory modeling (PM) is particularly well-suited to address complex socio-environmental problems like climate hazards and their implications for sustainable resource management and landscape planning. Despite its potential to inform planning and policy, particularly in conflictive contexts, PM has yet to become a mainstream practice for decision-making. While most PM research and development has focused on modeling tools and engagement techniques, multiple other dimensions must be recognized and articulated for impactful planning support. I present a PM platform, Fora.ai, that supports the iterative steps in PM: problem definition and goal setting, preference elicitation, collaborative scenario-building, simulation, tradeoff deliberation, and solution-building. I demonstrate the platform's effectiveness when embedded in a stakeholder-led process that integrates diverse knowledge, data sources, and values in pursuit of impactful green infrastructure (GI) planning to address flooding. I show how the combination of specific facilitation practices and platform features leverages the power of data, computational modeling, and social complexity to contribute to collaborative learning, creative and convergent solution-building for urban sustainability and climate resilience.</p>",

How the inherent complexity of textual data arises from its dependence on interpretation, context, and linguistic nuance, which makes its processing particularly challenging in academic research.</p><p>Emilio Munoz will present his work on Order-Aware State Representations for Path-Dependent Reinforcement Learning, exploring how we might design compact state representations that preserve chronological order while still being computationally feasible.</p><p>Phileas Dazeley-Gaist will discuss their ongoing work with the 2025 CGS Sympoietic Art Organism group. The talk will showcase a citation network grown by a small artist community in intentional collaboration working from a shared commons. Over a series of co-creative cycles, artists iteratively remix and take inspiration from works already in the commons, contributing new pieces while tracking citation relationships.</p>",
