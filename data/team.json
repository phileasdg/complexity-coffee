Examples include social collective action, the evolution of social and cultural institutions, or the construction of epistemic architectures. Methodologically, he is interested in the use of ethnographic data and narratives to facilitate the design of evidence-based models for positive social intervention. He holds a B.A. in Psychology and Criminal Justice from Virginia Commonwealth University, an M.A. in International Studies from the University of San Francisco, and a doctorate in International Studies from Old Dominion University.<\/p>",

More broadly, she is also interested in thinking about the importance of context-dependence in evolutionary biology, both in terms of how context-dependence manifests in our understanding of evolution and the historical and contemporary contexts in which evolutionary biologists develop and engage with theory.</p>",
